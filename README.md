### Hi there 👋

I am a senior Computer Engineering student at Stony Brook University 🌱. As an aspiring product manager and engineer, I am passionate about bridging project management, software engineering, and embedded systems design to build user-focused hardware and software products.

🔭 Currently, I am an IoT Data Analyst at Enertiv, where I am empowering building owners with data-driven insights by expanding our Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensor network.

Additionally, I am an Instructor in Stony Brook University's Science and Technology Entry Program, where I teach introductory programming to underrepresented minority and low-income high school students.

Previously, I was the President and a Project Manager of the Stony Brook Robotics Team, Stony Brook's largest engineering design team, where I led a group of over 50 students across 3 engineering teams in competition-based engineering projects.
