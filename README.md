### Hi there 👋

I am a **senior Computer Engineering student** at Stony Brook University 🐺. 

As an aspiring product manager and engineer, I am passionate about bridging **project management**, **software engineering**, and **embedded systems design** to build user-focused hardware and software products.

Currently, I am an **IoT Data Analyst at Enertiv**, where I am empowering building owners with data-driven insights by expanding our Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensor network.

Additionally, I am an **Instructor** in Stony Brook University's Science and Technology Entry Program, where I teach introductory programming to underrepresented minority and low-income high school students.

Previously, I was the **President and a Project Manager of the Stony Brook Robotics Team**, Stony Brook's largest engineering design team, where I led a group of over 50 students across 3 engineering teams in competition-based engineering projects.
